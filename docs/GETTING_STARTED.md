# Getting Started

## Installation

**Requires: Python 3.6+, git**

The toolkit *should* work on macOS, Linux and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The toolkit is installed using `pip`.
`pip3 install` will install something globally.
Because we may not have global access on the device, such as the lab machines, we'll give it the `--user` flag.
This installs into your home folder instead.

To install the toolkit, run `pip3 install --user stograde`.

> When you need to update the toolkit, use `pip3 install --user --no-cache --upgrade stograde`.

### PATH Note

In some cases, your path does not include the python binary directory.
Add this to your path if your command line tells you it can't find `stograde`.
This directory is located at

- `~/.local/bin` on Linux
- `~/Library/Python/3.X/bin` on macOS, where `X` is your version (check with `python3 -V`)

Consult Google or your local unix guru for help.

## Create a Directory

Make a directory for grading.
We recommend naming the folder after the course id, i.e. `cs251` for Software Design, `cs241` for Hardware Design, `cs253` for Algorithms and Data Structures, etc.

```
mkdir dirName
cd dirName
```

## `students.txt`

The toolkit uses a file called `students.txt` to know whose repos to download.
The file is a newline-separated list of their usernames.

The students file can also include delimited sections of students using INI format, which allows the `--section section-a` arguments to work.

##### Basic Sample

```ini
rives
piersonv
```

##### More Involved Sample

```ini
[my]  # this is a section
rives

[section-a]  # as is this
rives
piersonv

[section-b]  # the comments aren't necessary
magnusow
```

## First Run

The toolkit expects to have a `students.txt` file and a `data` directory where it is run from.
If you don't have the `data` directory, don't worry.
The toolkit can clone it for you.

Run `stograde repo clone`.

If you don't have a `data` directory yet, you will be asked if you want to download specs:

```
data directory not found
Download specs? (Y/N)
```

After answering with `Y`, it will then ask which class to download for:

```
Which class? (SD/HD/ADS/OS/MCS)
``` 

Once you have selected a class, it will download the specs and start to clone the student repos.

*If your course is not supported by stograde, then 1) let us know, and 2) use the --course flag until we add it*
